### challenge04: Proportion of Freeman and Slaves Among American Negroes

Another recreation of W.E.B Dubois's data visualisations, the original illustration was created with the help of students at Atlanta University where he was a 
Professor of Economics and History. Dubois used his had drawn visualisations to show the oppression of black people in the US (see the TidyTuesday repository for original figures).The steep drop off at 1860 coincides with seismic shifts in the US at that time, the American civil war breaking out in 1861, and certain politicians putting pressure on President Lincoln to emancipate the slaves, and later on the Emancipation proclamation issued on January 1 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation meant that slaves who managed to escape their masters became 'legally free'.
